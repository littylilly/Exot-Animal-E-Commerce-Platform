# 🦁 Exotic Animal E-Commerce Platform  

### 📌 Project Overview  
The **Exotic Animal E-Commerce Platform** is a **database-driven system** designed to facilitate the **legal and humane distribution of exotic animals** and their necessities. It ensures **secure transactions, data integrity, and efficient management** of orders, payments, and customer interactions.  

The project follows a **story-driven approach**, making the learning experience more **fun and personal**. **Gracie and Lilly** each met **Bhavin Patel** at different points in time, completely unaware of their mutual connection.  

**Ironically, through casual catch-ups, Bhavin realized they were all attending the same school and enrolled in the same Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) program at Georgia State University.** This unexpected connection turned into a close friendship, and when it came time to choose a project for their **Data Management for Analytics** class, they decided to incorporate their friend into the project in a humorous and engaging way.  

To make the **e-commerce platform** more relatable and enjoyable, they **curated a story where Bhavin purchases a lion for his new zoo**, blending their personal connection with real-world database management concepts. This approach not only added **humor and personality** to the project but also made the learning process more engaging and memorable.  

📚 **This project was completed for academic use as part of MSA 8040: Data Management for Analytics** under **Professor Saeid Motevali** at **Georgia State University** for the **Master of Science in Analytics (MSA) program**.
